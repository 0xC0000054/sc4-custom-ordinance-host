### Lua Availability Condition Function

This is an advanced feature that allows ordinances to define their own availability conditions using the game's Lua scripting system.
When present, it will be used in place of any other availability properties.

Like all SC4 Lua functions defined in mods, it must be uniquely named.
This is commonly done by prefixing the function name with the author's screen name, the mod name, or something similar.

The availability condition function takes no parameters, and must return a Boolean value.

```lua
-- The scoh prefix used in this example is the initials for the DLL's name, SC4CustomOrdinanceHost.
function scoh_check_availability_conditions()
-- Enable the ordinance when the mayor rating is at least +50.
return game.ga_mayor_rating >= 50
end
```

### Lua Monthly Income Function

This is an advanced feature that allows ordinances to define their own monthly income calculation using the game's Lua scripting system.
When present, it will be used in place of any other monthly income factor properties.

Like all SC4 Lua functions defined in mods, it must be uniquely named.
This is commonly done by prefixing the function name with the author's screen name, the mod name, or something similar.

The monthly income factor function takes the monthly constant income/expense as a parameter, and must return the calculated monthly income.


```lua
-- The scoh prefix used in this example is the initials for the DLL's name, SC4CustomOrdinanceHost.
function scoh_get_monthly_income(monthlyConstantIncome)
-- Add 1 $ in extra income for ever 1000 sims in the RCI population.
local extra = game.g_city_rci_population * 0.001
return monthlyConstantIncome + extra
end
```
